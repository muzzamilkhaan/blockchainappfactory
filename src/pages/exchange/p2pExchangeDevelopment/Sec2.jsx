              Cryptocurrency is a trending talking point in the current business
              sphere. We come from a digital era, where many industries are
              evolving towards assimilating cryptocurrency for their business
              because of the high efficiency, quicker, cheaper transactions.
              Especially a peer-peer exchange platform comes along with a
              decentralized, highly-secure, transparent transaction process.
