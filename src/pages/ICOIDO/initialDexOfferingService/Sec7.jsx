              Find the target market to sell your IDO tokens, as different tactics
              apply to various audiences. Apart from attracting people by hyping,
              it is important to build a stable community.

              Pick the blockchain for issuing your IDO tokens. While it is not
              necessary to release tokens on the same blockchain as the IDO
              project’s application, some trade-offs might be required.
            </li>
            <li>
              Begin the IDO token development process by creating tokens and their
              economics (commonly known as tokenomics). Ensure that your token’s
              economic model is focused on investors with predictability and
              profitability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Check your IDO host application (typically called IDO launchpad)
              based on its previous track record. Vetting should be done in terms
              of reputation, records, fee structure, marketing assistance, and
              more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, inspect your IDO’s documentation, codes, and smart
              contracts as Web3 investors’ eyes are sharp. Verify the relevance of
              your IDO through independent reviewers to ensure that everything is
              smooth. Reviewers can be called from a reputed IDO development
              services provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every step mentioned above can become easier if you work with an
              experienced IDO development company that helps with excellent
              services.
