            Initial Liquidity offerings have emerged as the most popular option
            for the launch of new tokens. It is a new financial strategy in which
            you stake your capital in return for a profit .In traditional
            exchange, the project developers may need to wait a long time to
            release their token. In the ILO process, liquidity contributors
            receive the new token in exchange for the liquidity to contribute the
            pool for AMM. A ready market will be available for your token to pay
            the price for your token. To pay this price, the AMM has to be backed
            by the liquidity pool. The liquidity contribution is made using stable
            coins that have highly stable values. Simply, you become a third-party
            funder to cover the project launchâ€™s legal costs. ILO is an attractive
            option for the feature of releasing the token in the readily available
            market.
