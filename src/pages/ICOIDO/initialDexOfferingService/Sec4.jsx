              The New era of digital assets experiencing its rife with the
              significance of blockchain technology. Its distributed ledger
              system offers robust security for digital assets and manages the
              anonymity of asset holders. This prominent feature in digital
              assets fascinates investors to digitize and manage their digital
              assets. The huge attraction of investors towards the platform
              empowered the blockchain industries by triggering the innovators
              and entrepreneurs to dive into the development of a Decentralized
              exchange platform(DEX). The blockchain ecosystem offers a
              fundraising opportunity (IDO) for contributing to the empowerment
              of blockchain with Decentralized Exchange.
