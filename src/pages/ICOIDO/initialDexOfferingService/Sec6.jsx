              available for a company to raise funds for the development of a
              company. Traditional fundraising is followed by banks and venture

              The evolution of blockchain and its success in cryptocurrencies
              facilitates multiple business development opportunities. Many
              companies made use of blockchain to raise funds through token
              sales. A company would enable the creation of crypto tokens and
              issue them to the general public in exchange for other tokens or
              major cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.

              There are different methods to make token sales for fundraising,
              namely Initial Coin Offering or ICO, Security token offering or
              STO, Initial Exchange offering or IEO, and the latest method â€“

              The projects issuing initial DEX offerings receive funds from the
              investors in the same way as traditional startups that receive
              funds from the venture capital. In IDO, the investors will never
              own any shares or equity in the project.
