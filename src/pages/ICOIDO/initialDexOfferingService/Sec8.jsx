            Initial Dex Offerings help in generating funds for new crypto
            projects. IDO development services can help in many aspects,
            irrespective of your role in the process. You might be an aspiring
            entrepreneur waiting to debut in the crypto world, an avid investor
            wanting to make fortunes or the owner of an IDO platform such as a
            launchpad. Anyone can benefit from IDOs as they use decentralized
            crypto exchanges (DEX) to distribute their tokens and maintain
            liquidity.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="mt10 text-center">
            An entrepreneur would benefit from the funds gathered through the IDO
            campaign, as they can access the funds immediately without anyone
            needing to give access. An investor can directly trade the IDO tokens
            without the need to wait till a cool-off period imposed in the earlier
            crypto offerings. An IDO platform owner can subsequently benefit from
            the advantages their platform gives to the end-users as more
            engagement means more profits in one way or the other.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10 text-center">
            Developing IDOs can also be advantageous in other ways as well. One of
            the main benefits is that the cost to list for an IDO is lower than
            other crypto offerings such as ICOs. IDOs also have a low market cap
            after listing to the public. IDOs also tend to be more open,
            transparent, and fair to end-users (entrepreneurs and investors),
            particularly benefiting newer and smaller crypto projects. Along with
            lower listing costs, IDOs also offer non-custodial token listing,
            which supports easier liquidity and tradability with a low slippage.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10 text-center">
            In addition, IDO development services can assist small businesses in
            establishing their presence in the huge crypto market by connecting
            them with the right investor communities. Such facilitation has been
            done by platforms called{" "}
            <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/ido-token-launchpad-services">
              IDO launchpads.
            </a>{" "}
            These platforms serve as all-in-one portals by providing investors
            with all the details about a listed project, including a description,
            whitepaper, native tokens, utilities, visions, and missions. IDO
            launchpads are also helpful as they have a lower listing cost for
            projects, reducing the burden on newbie crypto entrepreneurs.
