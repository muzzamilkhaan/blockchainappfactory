        Initial DEX Offering is regarded as the stable and famous crowdfunding
        platform that people prefer to invest in or to host. The reason is the
        building structure of the IDO is precisely carved to safeguard the
        investors and one who launches IDO carefully. This way, the Initial DEX
        Offered crypto projects will get more funds and also a very own market for
        them in the crypto space.{" "}

      <p className="mt10 mb10 text-center para">
        Initial DEX offering is listed directly in the cryptocurrency exchanges,
        and this makes the offering model more sturdy. Since it is listed in the
        decentralized crypto exchanges, the development architecture itself is
        more secure, and many threats are mitigated when they start to rise.{" "}
