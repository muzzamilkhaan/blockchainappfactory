                Firstly, you need to gather your ideas together, decide on the
                IDO launchpad venture’s features, and draft the project’s
                whitepaper.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then, you should carry out front-end customization where you can
                change the user-end features on your new IDO launchpad platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                Afterward, you should change the back-end features of the IDO
                launchpad platform according to the customizations made on the
                front-end.
              </li>
              <li>
                Meanwhile, you must also integrate the platform into the
                required blockchain(s) and create the native tokens for the IDO
                launchpad.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then, you should test the launchpad platform with all the
                customizations using various test cases. Resolve any arising
                issues immediately.
              </li>
              <li>
                Now, provide initial liquidity to your IDO launchpad by listing
                your tokens on an external DEX or your own DEX.
              </li>
              <li>
                Now, launch the platform for public use. Allow projects and
                investors to mingle to fulfill their goals and earn profits.
              </li>
              <li>
                Listen to user feedback occasionally, and release upgrades for
                your IDO launchpad when necessary to keep up with the flow.
              </li>
            </ul>
