            <h3>Ethereum</h3>
            <p>
              Ethereum is one of the legendary blockchains which has been in
              existence since 2015. The blockchain has the most trade volume so
              far due to its longevity. Most blockchain-based applications follow
              the ERC-721 standard or standards derived from it. The Ethereum
              Virtual Machine (EVM) is instrumental in helping other blockchain
              networks to thrive.

            <h3>Binance Smart Chain </h3>
            <p>
              Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is the parallel chain of the main Binance
              network, which is one of the most valued in the blockchain
              ecosystem. The network was initially released in 2020, and it has
              achieved what earlier networks could not â€“ Achieve faster
              transactions at lower costs. This has made BSC a new favorite for
              businesses.

            <h3>Polygon</h3>
            <p>
              Known earlier as Matic Network, Polygon is a Layer2 solution
              developed on Ethereum that has achieved quicker transactions at
              economical costs. The network has been popular with many businesses,
              particularly those based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), due to its
              swift response while existing upon the pioneer Ethereum main
              network. We should note that its tokens use the ERC standards.

            <h3>Harmony</h3>
            <p>
              One of the blockchains using the Proof-Of-Stake (POS) mechanism to
              validate transactions, Harmony has solved the blockchain trilemma of
              scalability, security, and decentralization. Although not very
              popular due to the lesser number of projects present, some famous
              NFT projects have their base on Harmony, which has raised many
              eyebrows.

              Avalanche is one of the latest entrants to the blockchain world that
              has already gained massive recognition due to its high speeds and
              low transaction costs. Many experts have predicted that Avalanche
              might soon become second to Ethereum or even overtake it. A lot of
              exciting projects, including IDO launchpads, are present on the
              network, making it a busy place.
