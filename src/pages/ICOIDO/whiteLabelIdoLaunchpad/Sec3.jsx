          An IDO (Initial Dex Offering) launchpad is a platform used for crypto
          project fundraising using decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs).
          These platforms take advantage of the decentralized nature of the
          exchanges they depend on for liquidity. IDO launchpads came up due to
          their benefits compared to the previous crypto offering models (ICO and
          IEO). Many successful crypto-based businesses today have been a result
          of IDO campaigns. IDO launchpads make it easier for newbie crypto
          entrepreneurs to traverse to the next level by exposing them to a
          welcoming and widespread investor community.
