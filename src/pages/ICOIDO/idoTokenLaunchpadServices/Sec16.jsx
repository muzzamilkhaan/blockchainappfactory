          Uniswap is among the largest decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges in
          the digital space. It has submitted itself as one of the pioneers in
          the field of decentralized finance. The Uniswap space is a blockchain
          protocol that makes use of liquidity pools and automated marketing
          makers (AMM) to initiate peer-to-peer transactions. Liquidity
          investors provide tokens to the pools, and in return, they are
          rewarded with a fee equivalent to their share of the pool.

          With respect to Initial Dex Offering (IDO), Uniswap has transformed
          into the system of choice for the distribution of a new class of
          crypto products such as governance tokens. The main operation of an
          IDO Uniswap Offering is dependent on an automated market maker (AMM).
          An AMM is a smart contract that provides management services to the
          pools that provide tokens to initiate a trading transaction. When a
          trade is processed, IDO Uniswap Offering’s AMM algorithm predicts the
          token’s effective price depending on the supply and demand algorithm
          between the tokens in the liquidity pool.{" "}
