                  <i className="fa fa-caret-right" /> Like every exciting project,
                  an IDO launchpad project begins with extensive planning, where
                  ideas are gathered through vivid interactions, and action plans
                  for every phase of the project are created.

                  <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                  Using all the information and ideas collected in the previous
                  step, the whitepaper for the project is drafted. The document
                  can be helpful in case the project needs external funds.

                  The front-end features of the IDO launchpad platform are
                  designed. It is necessary to build an interactive user interface
                  (UI) that gives an immersive user experience (UX) for better
                  results.

                <p className="port-txt">
                  <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                  After that, the back-end features of the IDO launchpad that
                  offer execution, security, and robustness to the platform are
                  developed and integrated. A great work here ensures an efficient
                  platform.{" "}

                <p className="port-txt">
                  <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                  Then, the native tokens for the IDO launchpad are created, which
                  is optional. Yet, having native tokens for the platform helps in
                  building a valued business in the long run.

                  <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                  After that, the crucial step of testing the platform is done.
                  Putting your IDO launchpad platform under various test cases for
                  multiple times ensures that all possible deficiencies are
                  resolved.{" "}

                <p className="port-txt">
                  <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                  Then, release the initial versions of your IDO launchpad
                  platform (Alpha and Beta) to a limited user base. Get feedback
                  from users on various factors and improve your platform
                  accordingly.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p className="port-txt">
                  <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                  Next follows the step of providing liquidity to the IDO
                  launchpad platform. Ensure that a sufficient amount of native
                  tokens are available so that users can buy tokens without
                  trouble.

                <p className="port-txt">
                  <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                  Finally, Develop your IDO launchpad platform for public use by
                  having some projects to list and a small user base. Let new
                  projects raise funds from investors through your platform.
