              Initial DEX Offering launchpad is a pre-made software that is used
              to setup and run a custom decentralized token marketplace. A
              decentralized token marketplace assists the investors to discover
              the latest upcoming cryptocurrency projects and fund those
              projects by buying them at a special pre-sale price before it
              enters the market. IDO token launchpad conducts a truly
              decentralized IDO with an array of customizable parameters to meet
              their requirements. Liquidity locks, sale price, token vesting and
              funding type can all be systematically adjusted, while initial DEX
              offering participants receive full transparency into the protocols
              in place for security and protection.
