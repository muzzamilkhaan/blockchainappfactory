              An IDO Launchpad Development allows early access of IDO tokens to
              the investors through decentralized platform. When executed
              effectively, IDO launchpads can offer successful token issuance
              events. But, it has its own drawbacks. In order to rectify them, a
              decentralized IDO launchpad has been introduced. It provides
              high-level flexibility, customization, and wide-ranging as
              possible. The main primary mission of this platform is to make
              IDOs fairer, safer and more sustainable, and more transparent.
              With the help of this platform, the majority of the projects can
              launch their IDO without limitations and restrictions. This
              platformâ€™s primary feature is to generate on-chain smart contracts
              that predict a range of customizable parameters such as duration
              and IDO stages, token vesting, liquidity locks, sale price, and
              other plug-and-play frameworks that simplify the IDO process and
              disqualifies the need for coding.
