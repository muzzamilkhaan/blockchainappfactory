              IDOs (Initial Dex Offerings) are the tokens of assets represented
              through a Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange (DEX). The IDO
              method uses the decentralized nature of the exchange that the
              assets are held on, thus enabling a fund-raising portal without
              the involvement of any external players. IDOs have some huge
              advantages compared to preceding capital-raising techniques for
              crypto projects, such as the possibility of fast trading, having
              immediate liquidity, and being an open and fair process. IDOs
              support cryptocurrencies and some stablecoins.

              An IDO launchpad is a platform that lists crypto-based projects,
              acting as an investor pool. Investors can search and buy tokens of
              the business project that they find impressive. The whole process
              uses the initial DEX offering (IDO) model. An IDO launchpad
              ensures that projects find suitable investors. Such launchpads
              allow business owners to enlist their aim to the wider crypto
              world. An IDO launchpad platform increases the possibility for a
              crypto business to be successful, as there will be a wider reach.
              Built-in automated liquidity pools ensure that the investors can
              cash out profits when they invest in the pool.
