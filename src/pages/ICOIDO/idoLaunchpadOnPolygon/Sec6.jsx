                An IDO launchpad on Polygon would have a higher user handling
                capacity due to the blockchain’s ability to process more
                transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Such an IDO launchpad would incur a low gas fee per transaction as
                it runs on the efficient Polygon protocol.
              </li>
              <li>
                Additionally, an IDO launchpad platform on Polygon would surely
                have the security and robustness due to working along with
                Ethereum.
              </li>
              <li>
                Due to its popularity and Ethereum’s reach, there will always be
                projects that would require the services of your IDO launchpad.
              </li>
              <li>
                Also, the blockchain aims to work interoperably with multiple
                blockchains in the future, hence making the IDO launchpad a
                profitable venture.
