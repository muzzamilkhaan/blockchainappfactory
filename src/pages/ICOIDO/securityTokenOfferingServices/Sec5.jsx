                of Blockchain App Factory. We believe ERC-20 is not an ideal
                solution for STO due to the gas prices, congestion of networks
                and changes in protocols. Blockchain App Factory will build
                customized blockchains with inbuilt smart contracts on top of
                the Ethereum or in Hyperledger or Stellar.
