          There are many offering models in the crypto market that created huge
          dominance and influence. A predecessor like the ICO had a clear
          dominance in the market where it had made record-breaking changes in

                <h5>Token Listing</h5>
                <p>
                  The IDO tokens are listed directly in the decentralized crypto
                  exchanges. This is a serious advantage for the investors. Here
                  the major perk of the token listed in DEX is that the need for
                  external marketing is very little.

                <p>
                  Since the IDO tokens are listed in the decentralized
                  exchanges, the liquidity is very high here. The crypto
                  exchanges will always have the flow of a very high
                  transaction, so the liquidity will not be a problem there.
