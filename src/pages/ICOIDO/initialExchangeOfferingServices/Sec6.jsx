            <h3>Leveraging User Base</h3>
            <p>
              The main advantage of going with IEOs is the user base of the
              exchanges where the projects are listed unlike in ICOs where the
              cost of marketing is high.

            <h3>Trust</h3>
            <p>
              The investors trust the fundraising companies due to the prior
              checks by the exchanges. Also, investors pass through KYC/AML,
              thereby, ensuring safety in investments.

            <h3>Listing</h3>
            <p>
              You donâ€™t need to go through the tedious process of traditional
              listing of tokens in the Exchange. The exchanges directly open the
              tokens to the secondary markets.

            <h3>Free from KYC/AML</h3>
            <p>
              The exchanges take responsibility for KYC/AML to verify investors in
              the platform and this ensures that the background of every investor
              is safe.
