            Here, things are getting started with the IGO and NFT gaming
            platforms, and we play the role of providing a platform to initiate
            them. But IGO will tend to grow more vigorously than any other
            platform. The gaming industry, as a foreseer of technology, has a very
            long way to move forward. From Meta universe to in-game attribute
            tokenization, there is still a huge room for improvement in the crypto
            space.

            NFT gaming platforms will be dropped based on the IGO in the mere
            future to support the asset where it can be utilized for playing. And
            we tend to continue the innovative development troop that powers the
            technology with the peopleâ€™s contribution.{" "}
