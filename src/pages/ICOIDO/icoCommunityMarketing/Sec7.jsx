          Why is Community Building an Essential Part of ICO Marketing?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The marketing game has changed in many ways over the years. With the
          advent of social media and other instantaneous forms of communication,
          there is more of a need than ever to build a sense of belonging and
          establish a loyal following for your product. This need is emphasized
          a great deal when it comes to marketing an ICO campaign.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The success of the whole ICO and blockchain initiative relies on the
          energy you put into engaging with people. Each day you should generate
          useful material, respond to questions, and participate in online
          crypto-related discussions. Your goal should be to have your followers
          feel as if they are a member of the team. Bounty contests, telegram
          groups, and social media engagement all help build a community that
          values your project as much as you value them.
