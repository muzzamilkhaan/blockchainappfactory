                    Every IDO should have a roadmap which is also known as the
                    timeline strategy, which lets the investors know clearly
                    what is the core idea of the IDO. They play a vital role in
                    giving pictures to the investors to invest in the particular
                    IDO.

                These are the major contexts to be met before the IDO is
                launched. The launching process may differ depending on various
                circumstances. Here the IDO launchpads are the best solution to
                launch an IDO easily without any hurdles. And the IDO’s launched
                on the Binance Smart Chain have more advantages, and they gain
                more efficiency because of the chain it hosts.{" "}
