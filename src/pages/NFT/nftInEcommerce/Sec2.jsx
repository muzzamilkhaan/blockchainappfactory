            Worlds evolutions with technology have created a very deep influence
            on the life of the people, and the tech evolution made them stay in
            their comfort zone and instead of making the people to port for
            gathering their needs, tech evolution made the gathering port to the
            people. E-commerce is one fine example of this, and just imagine
            what happens if E-commerce has a separate section filled with only
            NFTs to make it more understandable. The most famous E-commerce
            platforms have started launching platforms where you can buy NFTs
            just like buying other products in the E-commerce platform, and This
            is the normalization of Crypto in peopleâ€™s lives. NFT in E-commerce
            has diversified use cases, and more exclusiveness is yet to come.
