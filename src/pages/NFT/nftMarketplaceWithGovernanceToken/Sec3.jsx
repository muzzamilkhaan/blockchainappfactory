                As said above, even the NFT marketplace canâ€™t be managed by a
                very small group of people to reach the height that still
                remains untouched. And we prefer making developments that help
                our users to reach those heights with our users concerning
                developments. A governance token-based NFT marketplace is one
                excellent platform for such great objectives. The governance
                token is the concept where the stakes of the governance token
                will play a vital role in molding and shaping the future of the
                development of the protocol, where they are deployed. As they
                are led by the community of speakers, the platform can be
                considered to be the community-driven NFT marketplace.
