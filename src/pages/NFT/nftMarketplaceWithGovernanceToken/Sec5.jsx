              power among a community to get collective support. This collective

                    The governance token will also act as a validator who has
                    the ability to approve and reject a transaction in the
                    particular marketplace. The validations are done to verify
                    the transaction's trustability. The validator can reject it
                    if they find a flaw in the particular transactionâ€™s
                    trustability.

                    Since the NFT marketplace is completely community-driven,
                    every decision made in the platform can be approved based on
                    the voting of the governance token holders of the NFT
                    marketplace. The voters will play a very vital role in every
                    decision making, and they have the ability to reject a
                    proposal, and the majority of the votes will have a
                    significant impact on the platform.
