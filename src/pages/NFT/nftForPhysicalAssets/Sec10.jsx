                The centralized servers or finance are starting to see their
                downfall as the DeFI strongly influences the market globally.
                Brands, corporations are already accepting the Payments from
                DeFi. DeCom is a combination of DeFi and Ecommerce.DeCom offers
                a decentralized way for making payments on any commercial site.
                DeCom lets you be the controller of your own information and
                saves you from a centralized structure where each and every
                piece of information is monitored. NFT commercial spaces like
                marketplaces are adopting DeCom to provide you the supreme
                controllability over your information. You can buy any of the
                NFTs with cryptocurrencies, and your information can't be
                fetched from any sources.{" "}

                Here the Normalised structure is where an E-commerce website
                that sells mostly all types of products to users by delivering
                the product directly to the user's home majorly depends on
                centralized finance services for receiving payment. The adoption
                of DeCom in E-commerce will revolutionize the structure where
                buyers and sellers will have the prime controllability over the
                information and prices.

                          The process of minting NFTs must follow a smart
                          contract enabled blockchain, mainly Ethereum. These
                          smart contracts are responsible for adding details
                          like ownership information, no. of copy that can be
                          made of the token. This process helps add Royalties
                          and Scarcity to NFT.

                          delivered after several verifications are done.
