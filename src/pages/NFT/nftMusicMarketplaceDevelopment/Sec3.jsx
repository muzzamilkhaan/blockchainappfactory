            As the recent turnover in the NFT music world, the NFT Music
            marketplace platform is presenting the lesser-known music artist
            with a pedestal featuring the world as an audience to showcase their
            talent and earn a sack full of royalty from their NFTs. But the
            truth about these marketplaces is far from what they initially
            offered. These marketplaces are a proven blessing for artists with
            worldwide audiences. As they have listeners in the hundreds and
            thousands, their minted NFTs can be sold for millions and stack
            royalties in their already stuffed accounts. And on the other hand,
            artists with smaller audiences do not have the kind of people who
            are in a position while being in a pandemic to throw their money
            around.

            Due to the recent Covid pandemic, well-known artists can thrive off
            of their audience, thus still making big bucks, but there is a
            strict need to develop or scale a marketplace for small-scale
            artists who make their living from paycheck to paycheck. Due to this
            pandemic, this handful of artists owe their royalty check as low as
            $20 to $120 in a span of 2 months.

            Looking to lend a helping hand to these artists, people are now
            investing in NFT marketplaces specific to music. Unlike Sorare and
            Rarable, some of these marketplace work by inviting an artist and
            giving a chance to sell their NFTs. As music is prone to piracy, our
            music NFT Marketplace offers tremendous opportunities for the
            artists to mint their authentic composition in secured environments
            that assure their ownership and royalty benefits.
