          Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized software
          platform that has its own cryptocurrency, Ether. It enables smart
          contracts and Distributed Applications (DApps) to be built and run
          without any interference from a third party. Ethereum is not just a
          platform but also a programming language running on a blockchain,
          helping developers to build and publish distributed applications. Its
          pioneering innovation in smart contracts is the backbone of any
          services and business development in blockchain’s decentralized
          network. These versatile services from the network gain huge
          popularity and traffic to the network. The projects were piling up in
          the network for its enormous services and benefits. Such huge traffic
          resulted in performance lag and reduced its throughput with increasing
          transaction costs which reflected in the project’s performance too.

          Layer 2 solutions were introduced for scaling and infrastructure
          development which acts as a side chain to process transactions in the
          Ethereum network in a synchronized manner. In these second-layer
          solutions, Polygon is the prominent technology verified by Ethereum.
          As NFTs circulation is rife in the cryptomarkets NFT marketplace in
          Polygon will be a better NFT marketplace with efficient performance
          compared to other marketplaces in the crypto market

              Polygon is a Layer 2 solution verified by Ethereum developed in
              the vision of solving the issues of slow block confirmations and
              high gas fees for the mainstream audience with a better user
              experience. Polygon Network is architectured with a decentralized
              platform using an adapted version of the Plasma framework that
              provides a solution for faster and extremely low-cost transactions
              with finality on the main chain. Its architecture is designed to
              simplify the interaction between users and the decentralized world
              without worrying about the complexity of the system. The system
              ensures liveliness using PoS checkpoints which are pushed to the
              Ethereum mainchain. This enables a single Polygon sidechain to
              theoretically achieve 2^16 transactions per block which are
              expected to perform millions of transactions on multiple chains.

                  Fantasy sports are the type of games where you bid the players
                  and form a team and play for real cash. This stream brings
                  huge revenue and traffic from the market. Our NFT in fantasy
                  sports changes the entire system by tokenizing the teams and
                  players with NFT tokens in which a user can bid for the
                  tokenized player or team and participate in matches for real
                  cash or NFT. The traditional horse race is also adopting this
                  platform where the digital horses will race and the horses
                  will be in the form of NFTs. The price of these horses will be
