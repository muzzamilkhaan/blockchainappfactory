                    Building NFT aggregator marketplace software begins with
                    collecting ideas together and framing the official
                    documentation, including the development roadmap.

                    <i className="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right"></i>
                    Then, we proceed to design the platformâ€™s user-end prototype
                    by integrating user experience (UX) and user interface (UI)
                    features which will be tested by our professionals.

                    <i className="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right"></i>
                    Based on the suggestions obtained, we progress to form the
                    front end of the aggregator by modifying the prototype to
                    the pre-final version.

                    <i className="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right"></i>
                    Now, it is time to work on the back end of the application,
                    where we integrate the platform into the blockchain(s) of
                    your choice and program the smart contracts based on your
                    needs.

                    <i className="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right"></i>
                    Platform testing is the next step, where multiple tests are
                    carried out manually and automatically. Errors spotted in
                    the process are resolved promptly.

                    The last step is to launch the NFT aggregator for public
                    use. Make sure to perform upgrades often to stay relevant to
                    current trends and traffic.{" "}
