                Harmony is a fast, reliable, and secure blockchain that has many
                in-built functionalities of peer-to-peer networking and a state
                of sharding. This sharding property makes use of the randomness
                of decentralization, proof of stake, and the networking property
                achieving a high-level cross-sharding system and low latency.
                Many marketplaces for fungible and non-fungible tokens are
                created on this blockchain platform effectively. The primary
                feature of this platform is the zero-knowledge proofs for
                sharing data, which secures the customerâ€™s privacy.
