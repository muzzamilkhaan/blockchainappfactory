              In-game NFT assets in RPGs are limited in number to ensure digital
              scarcity. This also helps create a thriving economy run by players
              inside the game.

              In-game NFT assets are interoperable and registered on the
              blockchain to be sold secondarily. Players can sell them on
              marketplace platforms supported by the game’s smart contracts.

              Blockchain’s immutability allows players to retain their assets
              even if the game stops working. Also, NFTs cannot be tampered with
              easily, which eliminates fears of hacking events.

              Creating play-to-earn NFT RPG games also provides another
              marketing perspective for gaming companies. Gaming studios can
              advertise them as paths for players to earn passive income.
