              NFT RPG games are games that are based on role-playing schemes. They
              use non-fungible tokens to reward their players. In these games,
              players take up roles using which they should complete in-game
              missions. Nowadays, Web3 enthusiasts have been embracing such games
              due to the difference they bring. These games have combated the
              issue of one-way transactions common in Web2 games. Secondary
              selling of in-game assets, which was impossible before, has been
              realized. Hence, RPG game development has become the new hotspot for
              aspiring Web3 entrepreneurs. DeFi role-playing game development has
              also emerged since the space concentrates on incentivizing.{" "}
