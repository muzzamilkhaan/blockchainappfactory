                        Non-fungible tokens (or NFTs) are digital tokens that
                        represent digital and real-world assets on the
                        blockchain that have been changing things for the better
                        in various industries worldwide. It relies on
                        transparency and censorship resistance ensured by
                        intermediary-less smart contracts powered by immutable
                        layer-1 and layer-2 blockchain networks.
