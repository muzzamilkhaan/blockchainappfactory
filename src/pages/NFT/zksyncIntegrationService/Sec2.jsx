                As a name that has been garnering in recent times, zkSync 2.0 is
                a Layer-2 solution built upon the Ethereum network by
                MatterLabs. The solution has been evolving day by day, with a
                roadmap defined concisely by its developers. It is based on zero
                knowledge (ZK) rollups that group transactions into batches
                off-chain before executing them on-chain at once, thereby
                incurring low gas costs.

                zkSync 2.0 integration in NFT platforms can be ideal for
                ventures expanding their operation into the Web3 space,
                particularly those with substantial real-world presence. Also,
                since this network is built upon Ethereum, businesses have
                access to the broadest user base in the Web3 realm. Our expertsâ€™
                nature to learn and upgrade has helped us to offer zkSync 2.0
                integration services for NFT applications.{" "}
