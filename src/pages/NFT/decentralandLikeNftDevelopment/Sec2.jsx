              Virtual reality marketplace based games are computer-simulated
              worlds where the users can relate with each other, similar to the
              real world. The users are represented in the form of avatars, can
              interact with other users, build houses, play games and collect
              arts in the form of NFTs. Virtual reality and digital games are
              very similar and they often go hand in hand. These gaming
              platforms are in existence for more than two decades, with gamers
              spending millions annually, for acquiring weapons and items for
              their adventures.{" "}

              Decentraland is a virtual world game that is constructed on the
              Ethereum blockchain. The players can create their own avatars,
              monetize applications and contents. The real-estate contents in
              decentraland are permanently owned by the community, providing the
              users full governance over the creations. Ownerships of the lands
              are claimed by the users on a blockchain-based ledger of parcels.{" "}

            <p className="text-justify">
              In decentraland, the non-fungible tokens are represented as LAND.
              Decentraland charges the user with a commission when a trade is
              initiated, a percentage of the sale amount in the relevant trade
              is deducted and since it functions on Ethereum, users would have
              to pay gas fees for transactions through the game. Decentraland is
              a combination of both; a VR based game and an NFT marketplace.
