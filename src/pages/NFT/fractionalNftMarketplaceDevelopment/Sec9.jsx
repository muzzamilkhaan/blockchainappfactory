                    NFT here will be converted into fungible ERC-20 tokens. This
                    enables the owner of the NFT to sell in various open
                    markets. This increases the liquidity and the traffic for
                    the NFT &amp; NFT marketplace,

                  The Fractionalized NFT is not biased or an asset that only a
                  particular can afford to buy. Once they are fractionalized, it
                  is common for everyone to make a trade with the fractionalized
                  NFT. This also helps in increasing the market growth to the
                  peak. When a Fractional NFT is minted, the commission will be
                  high, and traffic will also be at its peak. And it establishes
                  several ways for monetizing.
