                    The NFTs is now an asset that has greater potential and
                    value. So the people who own the NFT marketplaces are more
                    concerned about making auction sales rather than instant
                    sales. This makes the process of liquidity a lengthy route.
                    And this is a serious challenge in the NFT.{" "}

                    NFTs values are now very high. Only the people with huge
                    resources can afford to invest in the NFT space. This brings
                    a biased situation where very small investors canâ€™t afford
                    to buy an NFT. The NFT growth will be promoted to the next
                    level only when everyone has the space to invest.

                    The Utilization of NFT other than owning them and selling
                    them is very limited. Though NFTs are now everywhere and are
                    used for various purposes, the NFTs can't emerge as the
                    token that offers various utilization in the crypto market
                    or in a digital market.
