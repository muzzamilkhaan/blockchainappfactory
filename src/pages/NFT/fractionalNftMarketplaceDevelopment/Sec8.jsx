                        Real Estate: A Real-world Use Case of Fractional NFTs{" "}
                      </h3>
                      Fractional NFTs in real estate can help landowners sell
                      their plots of any size by converting their documents into
                      fractional tokens. Such division of document land
                      ownership assists landowners selling typically illiquid
                      quickly and eases their burden in managing land deeds.
                      This is more advantageous than using fractional real
                      estate, as the land remains owned by the person who
                      fractionalized it in the first place. Our excellence in
                      creating platforms where fractionalized land NFTs be
                      created to generate liquidity for real estate assets of
                      huge sizes. Such NFTs offer landholders assistance in
                      decision-making and management through consensus
                      communities powered by the tokens backing portions of the
                      land’s documentation.

                      </h3>{" "}
                      In the real estate sector, fractional NFTs offer
                      landholders the opportunity to sell lands quickly through
                      streamlined transactions backed by blockchain networks.
                      Since everything happens via smart contracts based on
                      pre-coded agreements, the involvement of third-party
                      facilitators is ruled out. That means the associated costs
                      and uncertain time frames are out of relevance as well.
                      The ownership and transaction history are securely
                      registered on the blockchain that cannot be tampered with
                      by malicious parties. Getting on board the real estate
                      fractionalized NFT wave could be the ideal way for
                      landowners and aspiring entrepreneurs to raise capital
                      without giving up their holdings.

                        F-NFTs in the Real Estate Industry
                      </h3>
                      Traditionally, real estate has been a problematic sector
                      as most assets stay immovable due to a variety of factors.
                      Most such factors, including fraudulent ownership claims,
                      high entry barriers, intermediary processing expenses, and
                      extensive documentation routines, can be resolved using
                      NFTs. F-NFTs (Fractional NFTs) can get rid of these
                      negative points effortlessly by using blockchain-based
                      smart contracts that record transactions which cannot be
                      altered no matter what. Our services related to developing
                      NFTs for fractional real estate can help retail investors
                      to enter the real estate sector quickly and big-time
                      landholders to sell their holdings to a wide range of
                      investors without hassles.

                        NFTs’ Role in Fractional Property Ownership
                      </h3>{" "}
                      Although NFTs have gained recognition in the virtual world
                      as metaverse land parcels, it does not mean that
                      restrictions exist for what can become NFTs. Perhaps,
                      fractional property ownership of real-world properties can
                      be achieved through fractional NFTs. Such a facility
                      reduces entry barriers for retail investors to invest in
                      real estate. Since NFTs convey a more significant meaning
                      than the conventional fractionalized real estate fungible
                      tokens, it is possible for a landowner to set different
                      costs for NFTs backing various portions of the plot. Our
                      seasoned consultants can aid you in framing the perfect
                      plan to execute fractionalized ownership for your real
                      estate assets.
