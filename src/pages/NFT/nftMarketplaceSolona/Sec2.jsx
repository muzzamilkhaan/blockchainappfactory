                Non-fungible tokens have revolutionized the cryptocurrency
                ecosystem. The advanced features of NFTs have allowed the users
                to enjoy a smooth and safe trading experience. The popularity of
                the non-fungible tokens is immense as they provide certification
                for the authenticity of the digital asset, which verifies the
                ownership of the digital asset. Non-fungible tokens are traded
                on a special platform called the NFT marketplace. The NFT
                marketplace is a very flexible platform, it has the ability to
                be built on different blockchain platforms, depending on the
                requirements of the business models. It can be built on
                Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, TRON, etc., but at the present
                time, Solana based NFT marketplace development is the most
                preferred by business models for its outstanding marketplace
                features.

                The transaction process in an NFT marketplace is simple and
                user-friendly for the audience. There are many types of NFT
                marketplaces, such as open marketplace and exclusive
                marketplace. In open marketplaces, all types of NFTs are traded,
                such as music files, video files, trading cards, etc. In
                exclusive marketplaces, only a specific type of NFTs are traded,
                digital artwork collectibles are the commonly traded exclusive
                NFTs. Due to their popularity in the digital market, the
                development of new NFT marketplaces is on the rise, leading to
                many problems in the platform, such as network congestion, low
                transaction speed, etc. In order to eliminate these problems, we
                at Blockchain App Factory are building a Solana based NFT
                marketplace development platform.
