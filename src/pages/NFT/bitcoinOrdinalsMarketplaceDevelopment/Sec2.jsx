            Web3 is now head over heels with the recent launch of Bitcoin NFTs,
            and this buzz is to stay. The Bitcoin network’s unique initiation of
            Bitcoin ordinals allows users to shift their smart contracts to JSON
            data protocol to create Bitcoin NFTs. Ordinals, in short, are the
            order of transactions inscribed with data onto a satoshi (Sat) using a
            Bitcoin wallet. Minting directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, they
            require no side chains to store the asset’s metadata, unlike usual
            NFTs.
            <br />
            <br />
            Leveraging this ordinal protocol, you can now take part in
            revolutionizing with a feature-laden Bitcoin Ordinals Marketplace
            Development. We at Blockchain App Factory, as a prominent developer of
            pulsating NFT marketplace, assist you in bringing your collection to
