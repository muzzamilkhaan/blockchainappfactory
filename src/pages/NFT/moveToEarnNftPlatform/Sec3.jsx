              Why Will Move-to-Earn Games be the Hottest Trend?

            <p className="mt10 text-justify">
              Move-to-Earn (M2E) is a new mechanism even though the concept is
              old. The initial NFT boom had witnessed a massive growth of P2E
              games, which monetized people’s pastimes. Move-to-Earn games have
              been the result of the possible health effects the P2E mechanism
              could cause in the long run. One can now earn money for exercising
              of some form, which most normally would not do even if they know
              the health benefits.
            </p>
            <p className="mt10 text-justify">
              With people’s understanding of NFTs getting higher, Move-to-Earn
              games can make the most of it. A few M2E games have already topped
              the charts as a result of community traction, which turns people
              on these platforms. Such levels of attention and benefits will
              make M2E NFT platforms one of the long-standing and hottest trends
              even after the NFT boom.
