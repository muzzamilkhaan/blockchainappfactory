                The M2E-based NFT platform development starts with planning. You
                should decide on all possible facets of the platform, including
                target audience, gamification, market analysis, and competitors.
                The roadmap should be formed based on the decisions you make.

            <div className="diffTxt">
              <p>
                Now, you should create a prototype, which is vital in M2E-based
                NFT platform development. Based on feedback obtained from test
                users, you can implement them on the final front-end design.

            <div className="diffTxt">
              <p>
                Then, you should progress with developing the M2E platformâ€™s
                back-end features. Apart from making the front-end work, the
                process includes blockchain integration, creation of native tokens
                and smart contracts.

            <div className="diffTxt">

                Afterward, you should test the developed M2E platform for errors
                and resolve them promptly. Ensure that you utilize various
                automated and manual test cases to eliminate all defects.

                Before officially releasing your Move-to-Earn NFT-based platform,
                it is essential to market your platform so that you garner an
                initial community and traction. Usage of various proven marketing
                strategies is advised for effective outcomes.

              <p>
                Finally, release the M2E platform for public use. Ensure that you
                collect feedback from users and release upgrades frequently to
                keep up to date in the Web3 world.
