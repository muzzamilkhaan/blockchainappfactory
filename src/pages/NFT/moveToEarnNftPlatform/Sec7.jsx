          Even though Move-to-Earn NFT platforms are new to the circuit, they
          have already set the tone for future growth. These platforms have
          their place in the Web3 world, with a noble goal of benefitting the
          end-user in multiple ways. The purpose of Web3 technology is to
          empower the end-users by rewarding their time and data on web
          applications. M2E NFT platforms might add another layer to it by
          ensuring that end-users' well being is taken care of too. The nature
          of these platforms means that they can sustain in the long run as
          peopleâ€™s well-being stands first anytime.
