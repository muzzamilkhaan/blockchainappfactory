              How Do Move-to-Earn Games Work?
            </h2>
            <p className="mt10 text-justify">
              Move-to-Earn NFT platforms work similar to the earlier
              Play-to-Earn games, but with a slight difference that makes it
              worth the effort. M2E games work on the basis of rewarding users
              with cryptocurrencies for physical movement of some form. Such
              platforms are typically gamified and socialized in nature, which
              adds to the monetary benefits. Physical activity a user might be
              required to do can include walking, jogging, dancing, cycling,
              playing soccer, and more. Move-to-Earn NFT platforms capitalize on
              the earlier fitness tracking applicationsâ€™ success achieved only
              through including gamification and socialization facets on the
              platforms.
            </p>
            <p className="mt10 text-justify">
              The NFT assets earned inside the M2E game platform can be traded
              or staked on the in-game NFT marketplace to earn cash. They can
              even be rented to other users to earn passive income. NFT assets
              in such Move-to-Earn NFT platforms include upgradable sneakers,
              football, and raisable virtual pets. In-game cryptocurrencies on
              most Move-to-Earn NFT platforms can be used as both legal tender
              inside the gameverse. Also, such platforms have governance tokens
              to decide on the future of the platform.
