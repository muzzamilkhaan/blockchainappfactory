            A Move-to-Earn (M2E) NFT is a virtual token that a user can earn when
            they perform physical movement of some form (walking, jogging,
            dancing, playing). This novel mechanism has attracted a lot of
            attention recently due to its traits of bridging both virtual and
            physical worlds. Also, the Move-to-Earn NFT mechanism capitalizes on
            one major drawback of the popular Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanism. In P2E
            gaming, players need to spend more time on their mobile devices. Also,
            with technological growth leading to restriction of physical movement,
            M2E can be the ideal solution to make people healthy.
