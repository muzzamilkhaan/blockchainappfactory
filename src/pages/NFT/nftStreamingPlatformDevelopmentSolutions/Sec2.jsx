                Video streaming platforms always demand a sum from the creators
                to display their contents on their platform. This benefits both
                the content creators and platform owners, but the content
                creators lag in owning the complete ownership of the content
                they provide. These content publishing platforms like youtube
                and other streaming mediums may delete their content due to
                their policies. This sets back the video content creators from
                the freedom to publish contents. This also impacts the followers
                of those content providers. Blockchain’s innovative NFT’s offer
                a better business opportunity by creating a NFT streaming
                platform where the content creators can publish their contents
                in form of NFTs. The innovative platform benefits both the
                content creators and users with substantial benefits of
                blockchain.{" "}
