            Develop your Splinterlands like P2E NFT Game
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            We assist you with shaping your own Splinterlands like NFT game, where
            your users can purchase, sell, trade, and hold digital collectible
            cards. Splinterlands is an advanced version of traditional trading
            card games like Magic: The Gathering or Pokemon. Being a play-to-win
            game, it assists gamers in earning a passive income by winning the
            games. For all the games they win, they will earn real-time
            cryptocurrency. <br />
            <br />
            To further support the game operations, our game-cum-blockchain
            experts will help you in creating a native token for your game.
            Additionally, the game mechanics will be designed in such a way that
            these token holders will be incentivized with groundbreaking
            utilities. Similar to Splinterlands game model, we provide you with
            two imperative modes - Free Mode and Earn Mode. Players playing in
            free mode will not receive any rewards, while earn mode rewards them
            with real money, but players have to spend a little to enter this
            mode.
