              Splinterlands is one of the finest P2E NFT card games developed on
              the Hive blockchain. This game was previously called Steem Monsters
              and was played as a 1-Vs-1 battle between a crew of monsters.
              Splinterlands has nearly a collection of 300+ cards, each with
              different stats, rarity, name, level, experience, and abilities.
              Players collect these cards (NFTs) to create their own powerful team
              and battle against one another to show their supremacy. Winners of
              this battle will gain in-game rewards. Each character can be
              combined to level up their abilities, experience, and tiers.
              <br />
              <br />
              Splinterlands organizes various in-game activities, such as quests,
              ranked play, tournaments, etc., and players can participate in these
              activities to earn exciting daily rewards. They also play the game
              to earn card packs, rarity, magic potions, and its native utility
              token DEC (Dark Energy Crystal).
