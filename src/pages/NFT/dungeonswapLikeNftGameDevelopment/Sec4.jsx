                Our NFT gaming platform has a commerce market, where the users of
                the platform can convert cryptocurrencies of different types into
                the platform’s own native coin. This is to establish an ecosystem
                with the native platform coin as the primary dependency. The
                commerce market will support most of the well-established coins,
                and the list can be updated by the admin of the platform at any
                time.
