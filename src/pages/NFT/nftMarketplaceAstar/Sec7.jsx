                  <p>

                    technology, the need for NFT marketplaces for the genre
                    becomes high. Exclusive art-based NFT marketplaces have
                    earlier garnered a lot of attention irrespective of the
                    blockchain they have been hosted by, making a case for such
                    an NFT marketplace on Astar a lot stronger. With the
                    possibility of integrating extensive technological tools and
                    reaching a wider audience, an NFT marketplace for art on the
                    Astar blockchain will be a success.

                  <p>
                    Currently, blockchain-based games have been gaining
                    popularity, and they have been the building blocks for a
                    million-dollar market. Game-based NFT marketplaces have
                    always been a hit, and with the promise that Astar offers
                    through its features, there are a lot of games to be
                    developed on the network. This makes an NFT marketplace for
                    games on the Astar blockchain a great business opportunity.

                  <p>
                    In the current era, fantasy sports have become a favorite
                    pastime for many people due to the engagement it incites in
                    watching live games. The earning feature associated with
                    such games also makes it an attractive option for people to
                    invest their money. With NFTs, the fantasy sporting domain
                    has taken off to another level, and an NFT marketplace for
                    fantasy sports on Astar would only be a justification for
                    the fact.

                  <p>
                    One of the main applications that were looked forward to
                    since NFTs came into foray was the prospect of linking NFTs
                    to lands. Although not much in the real world, the metaverse
                    has taken full advantage of these digital tokens, and plots
                    of virtual land have been going for a lot of money. With
                    metaverses expected to grow in the future, an NFT
                    marketplace on Astar selling virtual lands will be a great
                    venture due to the inherent advantages of the blockchain.
