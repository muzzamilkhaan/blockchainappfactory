                <i className="fa fa-caret-right" /> Typically, a REVV Racing
                like Play-to-Earn NFT game development starts with documenting
                ideas in the whitepaper. Here, you must also decide the
                technologies, the development models, and the gameplay features
                that will be used in the game.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p className="port-txt">
                <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                Then, it gets on with one of the important steps of NFT car
                racing game development – Design. Here, you design the gameplay,
                user interface, and user experience features that will form a
                great part of the gaming platform.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p className="port-txt">
                <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                After that, comes another crucial part of a metaverse NFT racing
                game development – Back-end work. Here, you need to integrate
                features that dictate the security and robustness of the game,
                along with the smart contracts for the NFTs.
              </p>

              <p className="port-txt">
                <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                Then, arrive testing, a critical step in a play-to-earn NFT
                racing game development. Repetitive testing for various test
                cases should be done, and errors must be resolved to ensure that
                the platform is free of any deficiencies.
              </p>
            </li>

              <p className="port-txt">
                <i className="fa fa-caret-right" />
                The last step in the metaverse NFT game development like REVV
                Racing is to launch the game to the public. Make sure that you
                act on constructive feedback and offer regular upgrades to stay
                with the trend.{" "}
