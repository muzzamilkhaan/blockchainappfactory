                Art is a tenacious way of expressing all kinds of emotion. The
                influence of art on the people is very high. This hype and
                influence put Art in the limelight for many hundreds of years.
                Even after the digital era and technological development, art
                evolved with those technologies. Non-fungible tokenâ€™s initial
                stage began with the art, majorly the digital arts are tokenized
                into NFTs, and those NFTs went viral, sold for a considerable
                sum, which paved the way for the extreme hit for the NFT in the
                crypto space. Art NFTs have a very huge audience in the crypto
                space.
