                NFT Launchpad Development facilitates Minting and launching of
                NFT projects efficiently, which involves minting and marketing
                your NFTs. This platform supports creators to mint and sell
                their NFTs in a unique portfolio with a curated collection that
                allows collectors to purchase their required one at ease.
                Creators would launch on a first-come-first-serve basis or
                lottery model to fairly distribute their NFTs, thereby boosting
                community engagement. Also, the Launchpad provides gaming
                activities to benefit the investors who can use the purchased
                tokens to participate in.
