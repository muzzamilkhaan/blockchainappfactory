            The burgeoning NFT trends and its rare use cases make NFT more
            worthy and attractive in the crypto market. Its ability to generate
            revenues with anything in the world pulls audiences towards the
            crypto market. Its unique features and the instant spike in value
            tend users to experience the effectiveness of NFTs. Business
            developers and sovereign investors never failed to take their chance
            of launching and investing in this expensive crypto asset. This
            steadily supported the rife of NFTs and their supporting blockchain
            networks with stunning traffic, which led to the surge in gas fees.
            While popular artists and maestros in the industry reap the benefits
            of NFT by launching their own creations, amateur musicians and
            artists have begun to find their recognition in the globally
            accepted NFT market. But the surge in the market and the traffic in
            the blockchain network makes minting NFTs expensive with its
            humongous gas fee. This set back the blooming creators to find their
            space in the crypto market. To commence this lag in such a potential
            industry, we innovated a unique solution to benefit creators with
            funds to create and launch their NFTs through a platform called NFT
            launchpad.
