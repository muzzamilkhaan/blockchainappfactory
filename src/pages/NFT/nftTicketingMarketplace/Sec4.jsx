                  First, you should plan extensively for the NFT ticketing
                  platform platform. You should decide on the target audience,
                  technology, market, and competitors to frame the whitepaper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i className="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i>
                  Now, you should create the prototype of your new NFT ticketing
                  marketplace. Test it with a small set of users and get
                  feedback for future use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i className="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i>
                  Now, design the front-end of the NFT ticketing system based on
                  feedback received. The platform should have an engaging
                  interface to provide an immersive user experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i className="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i>
                  Then, develop the NFT ticketing platformâ€™s back-end that holds
                  it together. Here, you will also create smart contracts and
                  native tokens and integrate them into blockchain(s).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i className="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i>
                  Now, test the NFT ticketing marketplace for deficiencies using
                  various manual and automated methods. If defects are found,
                  resolve them promptly to have an error-free platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i className="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i>
                  Before launching, promote the NFT event ticketing marketplace
                  across various mediums. Garner an initial community consisting
                  of event managers, artists, and fans for the best results.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i className="fa-regular fa-hand-point-right"></i>
                  Finally, release the NFT ticketing platform for public use,
                  and gather user feedback. Ensure that the platform is updated
                  regularly to provide the best user experience.
