              NFTs are taking the digital world by storm and are showing a real
              progression from the normal world to metaverse-based avatars and
              other intangible assets. Putting together, all these contribute a
              lot to the emerging global ownership economy. The craze of NFTs is
              constantly reaching general audiences and even increases
              significantly every day. We have to agree on the strong fact that
              celebrities and influencers are one of the imperative reasons for
              the massive prominence of NFTs. This is because the celebrities
              and their followers see this modern-day concept of NFTs as a
              phenomenal opportunity to get closer than before. Acknowledging
              this trend, Blockchain App Factory aids Superstars all across the
              globe to develop their own Celebrity NFT Marketplace and take
              their rapport with fans to the next level by providing immutable
              ownership to the most cherished assets of the stars. We amalgamate
              the magnanimous power of celebrities and influencers to reach
              millions of people.
