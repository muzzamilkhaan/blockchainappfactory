                NFTs are the digital representation of assets and provide the
                certification of authenticity for the ownership of the digital
                asset. NFTs are unique tokens because the values for every token
                varies accordingly. Non-fungible tokens are built on blockchain
                technology, which allows the user / NFT collector to verify the
                ownership of the digital asset. NFTs are very flexible, they can
                be built on multiple blockchain platforms. Non-fungible tokens
                can be represented as any product that has the ability to be
                digitized, such as music files, audio files, video files,
                trading cards, artwork collectibles, etc. These NFTs require a
                decentralized exchange platform to trade on, these platforms are
                called NFT marketplaces, these marketplaces are built on
                blockchain networks, which secures the transaction data and
                prevents fraudulent behaviour in the platform. NFT marketplaces
                can be developed on different types of blockchain platforms,
                such as Ethereum, TRON, BSC, EOS, etc.
