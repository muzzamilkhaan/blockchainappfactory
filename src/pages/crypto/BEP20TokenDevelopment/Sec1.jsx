                BEP20 token is a token standard that is derived from the Binance
                Smart Chain network. This token standard is similar to the ERC20
                token standard of the Ethereum blockchain but with few exceptions.
                It is a known fact that the Binance Smart Chain is a fork of the
                Ethereum blockchain, hence, it provides similar functionalities.
                BEP20 token standard is created for fungible tokens that are
                developed on the Binance Smart Chain network. This token standard
                regulates tokens, which includes assuring the tokens that are
                tradeable when an initial amount can be set. This token standard is
                perfect for creating fungibility-based applications on the Binance
                Smart Chain.Thus, this fungible token standard is used for elevating
                business platforms to great heights. Hence, it is essential for a
                business platform to create a BEP20 token. There are many ways to
                create a BEP20 token; generating the token without code lines and
                creating with the help of a smart contract development company. The
                former way of creating a BEP20 token standard for the business
                platform is a very tedious process because it requires a highly
                skilled development team within the business. This procedure
                necessitates a significant amount of time and resources. With the
                latter, hiring a smart contract development company is the best and
                easy way to create a BEP20 token for the business platforms. This
                method reduces time consumption and furnishes the Binance Smart
                Chain project with a wide range of beneficiary factors and
                features.Binance Smart Chain is one of the best blockchain networks
                in the digital world. Thus, it is essential for business platforms
                to adopt this blockchain network and create their decentralized
                applications. Hence, coming into contact with a top-tier smart
                contract development company is an ideal solution. Additionally,
                smart contract development companies provide the business platform
                with a wide range of additional perks like marketing and technical
                support at a high level.

                One of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges today, the
                Binance exchange boasts of a high trading volume for a myriad of
                cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and now Altcoin.
                It offers its users benefits like high liquidity, low transaction
                fees, and extra discounts for those trading with its native
                cryptocurrency BNB. Offering services like trading, listing,
                withdrawing and fundraising, Binance has launched its own blockchain
                network called Binance Chain, hosting a series of conveniences. The
                Binance Chain was specifically designed to support Binance DEX. Its
                primary goal was to facilitate faster transactions. Apart from that,
                the network allowed users to issue new tokens on the chain, send,
                receive, and mint tokens, creating trading pairs between two
                different tokens to name a few. With this network, the Binance DEX
                holds the capability to handle trading volumes much higher than
                centralized exchanges.{" "}

                The Binance Smart Chain was built in tandem with the Binance chain.
                It runs parallel to the Binance chain and can also be considered an
                update to the existing network. It permits creating smart contracts
                on the blockchain and allows for new staking mechanisms to BNB. The
                Binance Smart Chain creates a network for traders, validators, token
                holders, and developers, who can enjoy the utility of both the
                Binance Network and the BNB token.

                Another notable feature of the Binance Smart Chain would be its EVM

                developers to deploy Ethereum decentralized applications or dApps on
                the Binance network. Following a Proof of Authority Consensus (PoA)
                mechanism and a 5 second block time, BSC furnishes its users with
                high-speed transactions that cost the participants on the network

              The BEP20 Token Development is the native, standard token on the
              Binance Smart Chain Network. It takes after the Ethereum token ERC-20.
              This tokenâ€™s main purpose is that it functions as a blueprint or
              framework that other tokens utilize and defines how tokens can be
              spent, who can spend them, and other regulations for its utility. This
              format is quite flexible and stands as an advantageous framework for
              developers to design and develop their own tokens. Therefore
              representation of anything in the likes of shares, fiat currencies,
              etc., is possible.{" "}
