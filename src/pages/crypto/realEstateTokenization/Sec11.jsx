              Starting Real Estate Tokenization, there are a lot of practical
              and legal issues that must be addressed
            </h2>
            <p>
              The law must be followed diligently in Tokenization. If not, it
              will lead to various operational obstacles affecting the token
              sale process.

              Government regulations will have to be followed seriously

            <li>
              There is a complete lack of uniform regulations regarding
              cryptocurrencies and tokens in all the countries. Hence, investors
              will find it tough to prove their ownership legally.{" "}

            <li>
              The tokens should either be recognized as shares in the SPV or a
              right to get cash flows from the property.{" "}

            <li>
              Self-regulation is not possible in Real estate tokenization as it
              brings back some form of centralization. They have to align with a
              set of well-defined laws.{" "}
