      Once you have decided whether to develop a crypto coin or a
      token, it is highly important to know how they operate.

    <p>
      Coins are developed by forking an existing blockchain
      network or creating a new blockchain. It can be used for
      conducting digital transactions anywhere.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      You can understand how a coin works by knowing its
      well-defined purpose, which can be for facilitating fast
      digital payments or used as a medium of exchange or as a
      store of value. A coin’s value will soar depending on the
      demand from investors and how effectively it is being
      promoted in the market.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      Tokens are of different types like security, utility, and
      equity tokens. It can be issued on popular platforms like
      Ethereum, EOS, Stellar, and Hyperledger. An existing
      blockchain network need not be forked for creating a token.
      Tokens need to have an underlying asset behind it.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      The most popular token is the ERC-20 token that uses the
      Ethereum blockchain network. Tokens cost less and are faster
      to develop than a coin.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      You can understand how a token works by understanding the
      functions of a smart contract and creating a token transfer
      event. If your token has a wide number of use cases, its
      value will increase over time.{" "}

        tokens created on popular blockchain platforms like EOS
        and Etherum are usually utility tokens as they can be
