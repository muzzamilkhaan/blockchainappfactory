                  If you believe in numbers, you would be baffled to hear that over
                  1.8 million cryptocurrencies exist in 2023, according to
                  CoinMarketCap, the famous crypto data aggregation platform. While
                  all of them are not in widespread use (some don’t even have
                  tangible utility), those being popular are driving the crypto
                  ecosystem’s growth. Despite such a humongous number of cryptos in
                  existence, the demand for new cryptos does not subside, making
                  crypto development a viable business option. This comprehensive
                  piece provides information on how to launch a token on any
                  blockchain with in-depth information sourced from industry
                  experts. Let’s dive in!

                  If you are new to the crypto realm, you might have been confused
                  by the intermingled usage of the words Coins and Tokens. While
                  most use them interchangeably, doing so is factually incorrect.
                  There is actually a fine line that differentiates crypto coins and
                  crypto tokens, which we will see in the upcoming subsections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Irrespective of the differences, both of them have contributed
                  equally to the crypto ecosystem over the years, with numerous
                  advancements expanding their scope in the mainstream world.{" "}

                <p>
                  Crypto coins refer to the native currencies of blockchain networks
                  that are used to pay for transaction processing and rewards for
                  mining, staking, and validation. Bitcoin’s $BTC and Ethereum’s
                  $ETH are pioneering examples of crypto coins while several others,
                  such as $SOL (Solana), $ADA (Cardano), $MATIC (Polygon), and $AVAX
                  (Avalanche), are gaining traction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since crypto coins are bound to a particular blockchain, creating
                  one requires a lot of effort to develop a blockchain network
                  before making coins. These are fungible tokens, meaning they can
                  be exchanged for one another and divided into smaller units, like
                  how we conduct transactions using fiat currencies.

                <p>
                  Crypto tokens refer to the digital tokens created on a blockchain.
                  These can be categorized into fungible and non-fungible tokens.
                  While the former is used for payments and crypto coin-like
                  functions, the latter is used to represent ownership of digital
                  and physical assets on the blockchain. There are even stablecoins,
                  which are tokens pegged to fiat currencies or precious metals.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Popular crypto tokens include Tether ($USDT), Uniswap ($UNI),
                  Maker ($MKR), and Axie Infinity ($AXS). These tokens can be used
                  for utility, transactions, governance, and equity, increasing
                  their versatility compared to crypto coins. Our blog will
                  primarily focus on the creation of these tokens.

                <p>
                  You can develop a crypto token to create an investment opportunity
                  for people who trust your upcoming business and need exclusive
                  access.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can use crypto tokens to offer loyalty programs for your
                  business, providing exclusive benefits to your close community and
                  attracting the rest of them to get incentivized.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such tokens can be utilized for payments like crypto coins but
                  inside your business application, such as an NFT marketplace or a

                  While creating your own crypto token, you should consider
                  implementing these features in mind:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The blockchain used to mint your crypto tokens.</li>
                  <li>
                    The level of centralization or decentralization determined by
                    the number of validator nodes.

                  <li>
                    The level of transparency shown by how much information is
                    accessible to an average user of your network.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The consensus mechanism to be used for transaction validations
                    such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The degree of security implemented in your crypto tokens to
                    reduce malicious attempts to access cryptos and sensitive
                    information.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The speed at which crypto transactions are processed on the

                  The General Process
                </h3>
                <p>
                  1. Launching your crypto token begins with framing its idea in
                  consultation with subject matter experts. Aspects such as
                  technological elements, tokenomics, utility, and long-term
                  feasibility are discussed and documented.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. After this, the process moves to the development phase, where
                  one of the two processes used in creating crypto tokens is
                  employed. We will see more about each of them separately in the
                  upcoming sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Now, we move to the phase of listing and promoting the crypto
                  tokens. By using various strategies and partnering with exchanges
                  and liquidity providers, you can build a trusted community
                  supplemented by high token liquidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. The token is launched to the public via a fundraising campaign
                  or a sale on a crypto exchange.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sections we will see below expand the second step in more
                  detail, as there are two ways to develop a crypto token.
                </p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                  1. If you opt to create a crypto token using existing tools, the
                  process begins by selecting the token minting platform.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Now, we enter the necessary information required to create the
                  token, including the token standard, token name, number of tokens,
                  maximum limit per mint, initial value, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. After paying the required cost for processing the token
                  creation, your crypto tokens are created, which you can list on
                  exchanges and launch for public use.{" "}
                </p>

                  Differentiator #2: The “Hard-Core” Way{" "}
                </h3>
                <p>
                  1. If you choose to develop your crypto token using the classic
                  method, the process starts by coding the necessary programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. These programs include smart contracts that contain all
                  information about the token, including ones that we had seen in
                  the above section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. The smart contracts are then tested extensively using multiple
                  test cases, and defects are resolved promptly.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. After testing is complete and marketing efforts are performed
                  in parallel, the crypto tokens are launched on the blockchain for
                  public minting.

                  The modern-day crypto space has been full of innovations that
                  include numerous use cases. While we might not discuss all those
                  applications in detail, our blog will focus on the top use cases

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Crypto tokens have been in widespread use for crowdfunding
                  campaigns ever since Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) took the world
                  by storm in the 2010s. Since then, there have been many crypto
                  fundraising models, including Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO),
                  Initial DEX Offerings (IDO), Security Token Offerings (STO), and
                  Initial Liquidity Offerings (ILO).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Numerous projects have benefited from crowdfunding
                  cryptocurrencies that could be coins or tokens. Ethereum, EOS, and
                  Telegram conducted some of the notable crypto token offerings,
                  particularly ICOs. Crowdfunding nowadays has become the way for
                  startup projects to build a reliable community while raising funds
                  to commence their missions.

                  Cryptocurrencies, mainly crypto coins, have been used widely since
                  the initial days of Bitcoin. Blockchain-native coins can be used
                  for paying transaction processing fees (often referred to as Gas)
                  and incentivizing users to participate in processing them through
                  mining or staking.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  These coins’ flexible nature allows them to be utilized for in-app
                  payments, making their equivalency to fiat currencies imminent.
                  One should note that these tokens conquer the most places in the
                  top 50 cryptocurrencies, establishing their role in the blockchain
                  space. If you are planning to develop a full-fledged blockchain
                  ecosystem, opting for a crypto coin can help you immensely.

                  More projects have started creating crypto tokens to supplement
                  their other ideas, such as business platforms and NFT communities.
                  Creating such tokens also does not involve a lot of work usually
                  associated with creating crypto coins for a blockchain. One should
                  note that these tokens can begin as crowdfunding tokens before

                  makes it easier to raise funds from across borders with minimal
                  intervention from centralized authorities such as banks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is essential for a project to create such crypto tokens to
                  include real-world utilities for users that would make the
                  community feel included in the project. With the prominence of
                  cryptos emerging further, using tokens to support noble causes
                  will become a mainstream use case.

                  advantage that is difficult to achieve in some networks like
                  Ethereum. Its usage of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus
                  mechanism takes advantage of its community to decide which nodes
                  will be used for validating transactions. Its provision for

                  <strong>“Crypto Tokens are 100% Secure”:</strong>While crypto
                  tokens are secured by immutable blockchains, there is no guarantee
                  they are fully safe due to numerous factors. Some include human
                  error, smart contract deficiencies, and hacking attempts.

                  your personal information will not be explicitly visible on the
                  blockchain, your transactions can be easily tracked by tracing

                  <strong>“Cryptos Don’t Incur Fees”:</strong> All cryptocurrency
                  transactions incur a fee that will be paid to people validating
                  these transactions. Most times, they are minimal, although popular
                  blockchains tend to have unbelievably higher fees during times of
                  congestion.

                  <strong>“Crypto Transactions are Lightning Fast”:</strong>This
                  point holds true for some blockchains, while not in others, such
                  as Ethereum. Even those networks offering faster transactions
                  might be subject to lower throughput during unprecedented
                  congestion.
