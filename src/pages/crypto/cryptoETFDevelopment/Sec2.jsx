          As enthusiasm surrounding crypto ETFs becoming a reality increases to
          new levels, market experts have begun exploring the business
          possibilities they might offer. A crypto ETF development platform
          might be one of the first business models to tap into these, as such
          specialized platforms do not exist despite not necessarily using
          blockchain technology. <br />
          <br />
          Even crypto ETF provisions can be created by large-scale firms and
          investment companies as a new way to reach investors. They can
          capitalize on retail investorsâ€™ interest in investing in
          cryptocurrencies without having to handle these digital assets
          directly.
