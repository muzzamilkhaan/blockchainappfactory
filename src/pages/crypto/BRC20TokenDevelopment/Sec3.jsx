          Created by an anonymous developer, this on-chain token involves an
          ordinal protocol that works by inscribing data into every Satoshi
          (Sat), which is Bitcoin’s smallest denomination, i.e., the smallest
          fraction of 1 BTC. This Bitcoin-based BRC-20 token standard can be
          traded only using a Bitcoin wallet. Our BRC-20 token development
          company makes use of the proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism and
          JSON data programming, easing the storage of endless data onto the
          blockchain directly.
          <br />
          <br />
          Bitcoin’s ordinal protocol is rather a new concept that allows the
          user to have unique data added every time there is a transaction in
          the blockchain. With these transactions made, the BRC-20 tokens are
          deployed. To be exact, each satoshi is given a sequential number based
          on the order of these tokens’ mining. To this number, using the
          ordinal theory, we inscribe the data upon a transaction, which can be
          a picture, a text, or even a video.
