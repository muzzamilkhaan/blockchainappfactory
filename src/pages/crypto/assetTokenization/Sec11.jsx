            In a simple, reliable and confidential interface companies can verify
            their investors. When the client signs up for our TAO, a simple
            questionnaire, few certification requirements along with the uploading
            of supporting documents are sent to their mail.

            We take the necessary steps in a legal way to verify the accredited
            investors. It is important to note that the background verification must
            be done via professionally licensed attorneys with ethical codes
            maintaining confidentiality.
