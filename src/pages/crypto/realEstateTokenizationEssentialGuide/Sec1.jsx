                  According to an April 2023 report from Statista, the NFT market
                  revenue is expected to exceed 3 billion dollars by 2027 – the
                  below image reflects anticipated yearly growth. With the NFT
                  market capitalization already nearing 3 trillion dollars, as we
                  write, it is understandable that NFTs are poised for a better
                  future. While new user adoption is a reason for such a meteoric
                  rise in NFTs’ popularity, NFT marketing strategies have their fair
                  share of this in hindsight. Note that most people enter this
                  new-age space to get their favorite NFT item they most probably
                  heard from a promotional campaign of some kind.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Loosely speaking, real estate tokenization is the process of
                  creating blockchain-based tokens backing real estate properties.
                  It has been one of the use cases of blockchain technology with a
                  high business and practical potential for the long term.{" "}

                  types of tokens based on their business requirements, and both

                  The Problem It Solves
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Traditionally, real estate has been notoriously difficult to
                  navigate for most people due to the ocean of processes associated
                  with it. Buying or selling a property through the conventional
                  system has been a challenging endeavor for people to accomplish,
                  and even if it happens, the financial impact will be substantial.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a plethora of intermediaries, legal documentation, and fees,
                  conventional real estate processes have been painful for
                  mainstream people. The high costs associated with buying and
                  holding real estate mean a major proportion of the world's
                  population cannot afford to get their hands on quality estate
                  properties.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Real estate tokenization can solve all of these plaguing issues
                  seamlessly through blockchain technology. From barren land plots
                  and individual residential houses to high-rise commercial
                  establishments and large-scale enterprise zones, tokenizing real
                  estate has opened up unseen opportunities for many people
                  worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This iconic quote from Jefe Bezos, the founder of Amazon, reflects
                  how conventional real estate is exclusively bound by location.{" "}
                </p>
                <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
                  “Real estate is the key cost of physical retailers. That's why
                  there's the old saw: location, location, location.”{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  While such sentiments could remain even after tokenization comes
                  into full effect, the degree of accessibility would increase,
                  smashing barriers for people to involve themselves in real estate
                  transactions.

                  Through the years, the real estate industry has enjoyed the
                  benefits of blockchain technology even after a slow approach to
                  adoption. While the global real estate market is projected to grow
                  to $6.27 billion by 2032 with a CAGR of 8.2%, the role of
                  blockchain technology could boost the figure further. This is
                  supported by the fact that tokenized real estate amounted to $128
                  million in 2020, just before the crypto bullish season.

                  Static real estate tokens, as their name suggests, are tokens that

                  non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for the process to replicate the role

                  transactions. These NFTs contain crucial details like the
                  property’s measurements, location, past owners, and price history.

                  procedures are integrated into the real estate tokenization
                  platform. These compliance protocols ensure all transactions are
                  legally valid and are in accordance with necessary regulatory
                  requirements. In this way, the identity of all platform users is
                  known without disturbing the application’s decentralized nature.

                  Tokens are distributed through a token sale or Initial Coin
                  Offering (ICO) to investors and private placements to existing
                  property owners. Necessary provisions should be set in place in

                  <br />
                  After initial token distribution, the real estate project can list
                  property tokens on reputed cryptocurrency exchanges or NFT real
                  estate marketplaces. Doing so can foster secondary sales and
                  ensure liquidity for the estate tokens. This also impacts these
                  tokens’ prices based on the number of transactions occurring
                  daily.

                  The tokenization project should go beyond facilitating secondary
                  exchanges by ensuring that profits reaped by the property are
                  proportionately distributed to token holders. Smart contracts can
                  be used to automate the process by facilitating direct
                  transactions to user wallets periodically. Reporting mechanisms
                  can inform investors of all finances related to the property they
                  had invested in.{" "}

                  <br />
                  Since real estate tokenization involves regular financial
                  transactions, it is essential to conduct regular audits and
                  publish reports for investors. Doing so aids the secondary market
                  greatly, as investors will have real-world numerical data to
                  interpret. Likewise, the smart contracts involved should be
                  checked for deficiencies, and errors should be resolved on the go.

                  The project should have strategies in place for investors wishing
                  to exit the program through various means. Selling the property,
                  distributing profits, and redeeming tokens for the monetary value
                  of a portion of the property are some pathways generally used by
                  projects.

                  As time goes on, the real estate tokenization development venture
                  should ensure compliance with regulatory requirements as more
                  rules are brought forward. Alterations should be made to
